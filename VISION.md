# Vision: gh-pr-web2cli

**Goal:**
To provide developers with a CLI tool that delivers the full content and context of a GitHub Pull Request reviewâ€”matching the information available in the GitHub web UI, but structured for terminal and offline workflows.

**What this means:**
- All code diffs, inline review comments, review threads, and PR metadata are available in the CLI.
- The output is structured, readable, and suitable for terminal or offline review.
- No information is lost compared to the web UI (except for rich formatting and interactivity).
- Enables code review, auditing, and collaboration for CLI-first, remote, or accessibility-focused teams.

**Why:**
- Many developers prefer or require terminal-based workflows.
- Web UI is not always accessible, scriptable, or suitable for automation.
- True parity between web and CLI empowers more flexible, inclusive, and automated code review processes.
